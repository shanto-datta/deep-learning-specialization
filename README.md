# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains my solutions and practice notebooks for the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by DeepLearning.AI. The specialization is divided into five courses, and each course includes coding assignments and practice exercises.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into five folders, one for each course in the specialization. Each folder contains:

- **Practice notebooks**: `.ipynb` files for practicing concepts.
- **Solved notebooks**: Corresponding `_solved.ipynb` files with completed solutions.
- **Datasets**: Supporting data for the notebooks.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and scripts used in the notebooks.

### Folder Details

1. **Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
   - **Description**: The "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course, part of the Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI, provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning. It covers key concepts such as building and training fully connected neural networks, understanding technological trends, optimizing network parameters, and implementing forward and backpropagation techniques. The course is divided into four modules, exploring deep learning applications, neural network basics, shallow and deep neural networks. By the end, learners gain a solid foundation to apply deep learning techniques to real-world problems.
   - **Folders**: `W2A1`, `W2A2`, `W3A1`, etc - W2(week 2)
   - **Content**:
     - `Python_Basics_with_Numpy.ipynb`: Practice notebook.
     - `Python_Basics_with_Numpy_solved.ipynb`: Solved notebook.
     - `Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb`: Practice notebook.
     - `Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_solved.ipynb`: Solved notebook.
     - **Utilities**: Helper scripts like `test_utils.py` and `lr_utils.py`.

2. **Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks**
